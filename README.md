# Trivia Game
The Trivia Game provides a predefined amount of time within which the user can answer questions related to 1st grade knowledge.  The user clicks the Start button to start the timer.  The time remaining is displayed in the banner at the top of the page.  

Each question is displayed separately.  If the user chooses an answer, or if the timer runs out, the correct answer is displayed.  The next question is displayed automatically.

Once all questions are done, the final results are displayed.  The user is given an option to try the quiz again.
